# 🧠 Handwritten Digit Recognition

This is a minimal Python project that trains a neural network to recognize handwritten digits from the **MNIST** dataset using **TensorFlow/Keras**.

The entire logic (data loading, model building, training, and prediction) is contained in `digit_classifier.py`.

## 📦 Features

- Loads the MNIST dataset (60,000 training + 10,000 test images)
- Trains a simple neural network with two hidden layers
- Evaluates accuracy on the test set
- Allows prediction on custom digit images (optional)
